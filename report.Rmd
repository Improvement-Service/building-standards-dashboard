## KPO 4 Score
```{r echo=FALSE, comment= ""}
## Set up text for KPO4 
kpo_data <- kpo_data %>% filter(`Tracking Link` == "Total")
local_auth <- "Aberdeen City" ##will need to select LA based on log in details
     curr_year <- yr2fy(2022)
     KPO4_ytd <- kpo_data %>% filter(id == "local authority") %>% pull(KPO_score)

     abbel_kpo4 <- ifelse(KPO4_ytd > scotAv_kpo4, "higher", "lower")
     
```

This indicator summarises performance across all questions, with differential weightings based on importance. For `r la` in `r curr_year`, overall performance is at `r KPO4_ytd` for the year to date. This is `r abbel_kpo4` than the Scotland average of `r scotAv_kpo4` and `r hilow_kpo4` than the target value of 7.5.
