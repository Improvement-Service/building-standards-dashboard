This indicator summarises performance across all questions, with differential weightings based on importance. For `r la` in `r curr_year`, overall performance is at `r KPO4_ytd` for the year to date. This is `r abbel_kpo4` the Scotland average of `r scotAv_kpo4` and `r hilow_kpo4` the target value of 7.5.

## Staff
```{r echo=FALSE, comment= ""}

In this year for `r la` to date for the question "How would you rate the service offered by staff?" responses have been `r staff_txt$pos_or_neg` with `r staff_txt$total_good` percent saying that it was good or very good. The greatest proportion of respondents said they felt it was `r staff_txt$max_name` at `r staff_txt$max_perc` This was followed by `r staff_txt$sec_name` at `r staff_txt$sec_perc` For Scotland overall, most respondents said that the service received was `r staff_txt$scot_max_name` at `r staff_txt$scot_max_perc`
