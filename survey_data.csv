This made the whole process very protracted. ,4,The warrant reports were terrible and not constructive. The warrant officer would not discuss the application so it was impossible to get any direction on requirements and despite numerous resubmissions most of the comments remained. I have never in over 20yrs experienced such wilful obstruction. ,4,4,3,The entire service was totally dysfunctional in this instance. The only reason I note the response time as poor and not very poor is because the officer returned warrant reports very quickly. The reports however took no cognisance of the revised submission and just repeated the same points. ,4,Fairness was even a consideration. My experience was of a wilful and malicious abuse of authority.,4,"As noted in all answers above they service received was not only totally unacceptable I seemed to be subject to the will of a surveyor who had gone totally rouge. I did have commutations with his line manager and at one stage was told that there were know issues and its implied that there was nothing that could be done avoid the issues. This is totally unacceptable. I believe that the there were potentially health issues with the surveyor , but I think that it is a total management failure that they were left to operate unsupervised. This caused a great deal of stress for me personally and also the client, not to mention the consequential delay and expense.

The lack of initiative and forethought shown by supposedly competent council officers is appalling. Petty excuses why a simple task or request can't be met/done seem all to ready to be used. I had to speak to a senior office (Head of Service), who was excellent, to get anything near the quality of service and advice I would expect of professionals and I work in the property sector.

Previous plans were not available due to a 'broken' piece of equipment. There was no flexibility in the system. Actually speaking to an officer was extremely difficult. Advice on the Council website regards this department was incorrect. Only when I pushed on a point did progress happen.  ,"My experience was one where the Council no longer exists to serve the people within the city, but to put up reasons why some simple task can't be done.
I call on council services very rarely. I have worked in local government for over a decade and to an extent understand the demands placed on it. I am a reasonable and educated individual but found the Glasgow City Council almost impenetrable. Front line staff appear to lack basic knowledge of the service they provide. Officers are only available at certain point of the day and days of the week. I had to badger and push to get a sensible conversation to explain my situation, ask questions as to what was required of me in order to expedite my reason for calling on the council service. The senior officer (Head of Service) was very helpful, but the level of information I was seeking should be provided by front line staff, not senior management!!!
Please can Glasgow City cease using their automated phone call routing and employ humans with an understanding of Council services and can direct calls to another human. The phone system is clearly designed to put people off making contact with the council or give up very quickly on their journey.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

I accept that this was brought in to prevent developers sitting on swathes of land and applications for years before progressing but in the case of domestic projects it can cause some issues.  I often have several projects on the go at one time and that includes both planning and warrant.  In that case it's really easy to loose track of timeframes for projects especially when dealing with a client who is either changing their mind or wants to approach a project at their pace on site.  Similarly obtaining tenders is now almost impossible in the old school 3 week timeframe and in some cases can be months.  I think both planning & building standards need to have clear contact instructions from an agent prior to issuing a deemed refusal.  This often doesn't happen and can lead to having to re-apply which really is a waste of time for both the agent and Building Standards.  Whikst I can see the need for the process I think there should be a better way of handling it.,1,1,1,-,1,-,1,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Initial building warrant reports are mostly adequate, but in several cases the clipped language used, makes it difficult to understand what it is that is a problem - there is not enough description provided to make a meaningful response without substantial guesswork on our part.

In addition, there are known members of the buuilding control team who are approaching their role in a completely different way to the rest of the team, meaning there are obvious inconsistencies in service and communication provided.
A major problem that we see is the reluctance to do site inspections during the works, to look at drainage, structure etc. while the work is ongoing. This was a valued service in days past.
Along with that, there the helpdesk has been scaled back to a meaningless service, it is ineffectual, remote, inaccessible and completely not fit for purpose.
This is exacerbated by officers who are unapproachable, uncontactable and hiding being behind 10 day automatic response emails.
There is also major flaw in the continuity of service now when different teams and therefor individuals are preparing reports on projects to the individuals dealing with completion inspections. Their expectations of what should have been included in a warrant or not varies wildly and there is no accountability between them with several inspections raising new points long after there is a point to easily address them ie when it is on a drawing - this is by far one of the most disappointing, bordering on terrible, effects of the recent changes introduced to the systems.",2,"Overall, most staff are fair, although as mentioned about, there remain a few maverick officers who are simply not fair and have such a personalised view of what is required, it is almost impossible to find acceptable solutions.",3,"Please take note of the previous points.

Requests to view previous Building Warrant applicants (BSP18 forms) are still being declined. It was very helpful previously when we were able to attend EAC offices to view files. It meant that level of information contained in Building Warrant applications (where it was an existing property) that we submitted was of greater detail and accuracy and as there had been prior dialogue with the Building Standards team before submitting the application it meant that the application process went more smoothly.

Service offered by staff - The members of staff (surveyors via phoneline and email) are willing to take time to explain queries and this leads to much better communication. Being able to speak directly to the assigned surveyor helps greatly in streamlining the process and is appreciated.

Building warrant applications appear to be assessed in a hap hazard way with a view to finding problems and obstacles rather than being customer focused to find a resolution.  I have also experienced a long wait for a dispute resolution process which appears non transparent and involves a closed group of Building Standards authorities not the wider profession, therefore I think it is biased.  Across all authorities I think there is far too much inconsistency of evaluating building warrant applications and too much autonomy by individual case officers with no oversight leaving agents and applicants at their mercy.  There appears to be no understanding of the wider profession and overall stages in a construction project.  A building warrant is half way through an architects service for example.  A building warrant is there to show technical compliance and we shouldn't be expected to provide extensive construction details to satisfy individual officers.  This process costs time and money and each request either causes a cost to the agent or directly to the applicant.  We are so frustrated with the process now that we charge additional fees to clients post warrant submission to allow for the sometime extensive work required to obtain a building warrant.",3,"I have received a report from building standards that are clearly ""save as"" or ""cut and paste"" from another report with no relation to the specific project.  I also find the reports vague in what they are asking for - be more direct in identifying the specific Building standards clause or requirement - don't leave the agent guessing.

This includes Magnalocks & Labss reports.,4,"BS requesting additional works on site at completion stage which are outwith the Domestic Technical Standards and outwith previously approved BW drawings (Magnalocks). The reason for this was a WLC Building Standards Technical note which was not made available prior to completion application.

BS requesting additional works due to LABSS report which the LABSS paper author confirmed was not required, this item cost an additional 5-figure sum to the project (LABSS paper INFOP24).

The project involved a Staged application (Stage 1 - substructure - foundations, drainage, etc & Stage 2 - superstructure). When the 1st Amendment to Warrant application was made it was rejected because the amendments related to both Stage 1 and Stage 2, WLC requested 2no. separate Amendment applications were made for this. This is not noted in the Procedural Handbook, WLC were effectively asking for an 'Amendment to an Amendment' application, no proper explanation was giving for this other than it is how WLC always operate.
",4,"The BS officers dealt with on site and during the warrant application stage were professional and forthcoming with information. 
The issues we have experienced have cost a great deal of labour and monies across this project and appear to stem from a managerial level within WLC. There is a culture of appearing to be 'consistent' within WLC however it is our opinion that this is 'inconsistent' with all other local authorities across Scotland. The issues we have faced are outwith the Technical Standards and Procedural Handbooks and it is clear that WLC are making their own rules regarding Building Standards compliance.

Plus I made a complaint to the council but it did not change the advice. ,4,"I asked many roofing contractors in my area if the work needed a Building Warrant and every one stated they did not. When I explained this to the section manager, that this work was being carried in my own road,  I was told they cannot check every roofing contractor. ",The council stated that I need a Building Warrant where all other roofing contractors stated I don’t.  This has left me in a state of limbo with an ageing roof that I cannot change as no contractor knows how to apply for a Building Warrant with appropriate drawings. The rules should be adhered to across the whole area not to the only person who bothers to ask the question. ,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

It was the previous owner and I understand that all correspondence will have went through them. However I have purchased the property before the certificate was issued and before inspection has taken place. There are 2 issues that I believe have not been picked up at the inspector who visits the property and there has been no opportunity for me to talk to someone about it. 
The first issue being the window to the front of the extension had not being sealed underneath the sill leaving a 30mm gap and allowing a draft into the room. 
Second issue being the decorative cast stone under the window is completely loose and you can move by hand. I have young children and this is very dangerous. I’m not sure if this helps support the window. I am very concerned and confused to why this has not been picked up on the day of the survey.

On both occasions I found the team to be very knowledgeable, helpful and always there to answer any questions that I may have had, even though they, themselves were always busy and under pressure. Through time, dealing with certain individuals, you built up a rapport. I have been in the building trade a long time, but have to say, through all the various councils and building control officers and staff, I have to say that many excelled in giving information or help that was timely, when promised, often getting back to me, before an agreed timeline which I have not experienced anywhere else, nor heard of this from others, whom I have worked with in the past and shared experiences. The staff should be proud of themselves for delivering a top class service and setting standards that can only be admired.",1,"All communication, was timely, often before agreed timelines, which was very helpful and often these guys went above and beyond. ",1,1,1,"I never had any issues with any staff as I found everybody to be committed to their job, from going into the building early in the morning to hand in paperwork, long before office staff started, it was taken from me and put behind the desk to be dealt with by staff upon arrival, handing in paperwork or drawings etc, the staff were always kind and considerate and nothing was a problem. If I needed to speak to a building control officer, they would come through to answer a query, despite being busy. I was always impressed by the attention and length the staff would go to in order to help me. ",1,"The staff are professional to be approached on any level, from somebody who is used to dealing with building standards on a daily basis, or somebody who just does a bit of DIY and is not used to the terminology of a construction environment. Either way, I found I was always treated with respect and during lockdown, where times were tough, certain staff shone through Covid.",1,"Certain Individuals over the years made my experience enjoyable, despite having a few complications along the way on my build, I was able to talk to them and find solutions. Sadly some of these guys have retired now and will be missed by their colleagues and many of the builders whom they built up solid reputations and friendships over the years. I am grateful that my experience was made better by working with these individuals.","During my build, it was fraught with problems, always the way with a renovation. I had family who were unwell and I lost, made redundant twice due to circumstances out with my control and a whole host of general problems that most people and family have daily. My building control officer, Mr D Hale whom I have the utmost respect for, for helping me get through some tough moments, by granting me extensions when my timing was wrong or we had bad news and struggled in general. He was always there when I needed a question answered, or advice for an alteration, or clarification, which was quite a lot. In all honesty, He was Fantastic with how he treated me and my family when we needed compassion and wriggle room when life was not going as per the plan. This is why I rate building control so highly, because of the level of sheer professionalism that was given to me, more so when Covid reared it's ugly head. Tough times yet these guys, continued to work from home on a different level which can only be admired.  Another situation when Covid Came, my Building warrant ran out and try as I might, I could not get through to FDC to renew as the phone lines could not cope and crashed. I eventually managed to leave a phone message, and A gentleman Called Colin Called me back. I explained my problem, which he fixed there and then. The sheer relief was unbelievable and the worry went away over night, just by Colin calling me back and talking about my dilemma, which he fixed. I emailed Colin several times over the course of Covid, and always got the same response, helpful, kind and considerate. He recognised my problem, yet took ownership of it and made it his own. I slept well that night all due to his actions which, can and never will be underestimated and I am grateful for Colin making the time, when he admitted to me, he was swamped by many other callers in similar positions. And when you look at the situation, these two individuals stand out, because, they not only are Professional in their chosen trade, but were not prepared for Covid like the rest of us, yet rose to the challenge and went by far and above the call of duty that was expected of them at that time. I am truly in their debt for all they have done for me and can only speak highly of the building standards at Falkirk Council.

I explained this to Paul Donnelly over the phone and he was very understanding, but when he came out to the property to inspect the work done, he had to inform me that he couldn't provide the completion certificate as the work did not match the plans submitted. He advised me what I needed to do and went above and beyond to ensure that everything was done to ensure that the completion certificate was provided on time for my house sale to go through. Not having any experience of building works and the rules and regulations that go with it the help and advice Paul offered during that time was invaluable and hugely appreciated making a very stressful and trying situation a little easier to bear.

The first inspector was Mariane Benzie with whom there were countless delays and muddles due to her being on sick leave etc.
A new inspector Michael Jones came onboard a year ago and we corrected the faults he found.
The architect submitted all the documents to the portal.
It was discovered that our case number was listed under two different addresses.
Mr Jones contacted on 25 July this year to say he would look into why he did not find our document on the portal and get back to us in two days.
It is now 14 August and we have heard nothing from Mr Jones, despite emails and the architect's offer to telephone.

This has been a situation in which I, the owner, have exerted almost superhuman patience, but I am now at the end of my tether

As Chartered Architects we are required to carry full Professional Indemnity for all the work we undertake and have over 30 years of directly relevant design & building experience. The BW process should be a technicality that is administered effectively. It is therefore unfair to treat a skilled professional in the same way as an unskilled D.I.Y applicant where every base has to be covered by correspondence and paperwork. You waste our time as much as you waste your own!,3,We have dealings with Building Standard from other Local Authority areas and The Moray Council continues to be the most difficult and time consuming LA from which to obtain a BW Consent for a small scale domestic application for a single dwelling .,"Each of our BW submissions are directly informed by the BW Consents & process undertaken previously. We have made over 300 submissions small scale domestic application for a single dwellings. It takes longer now for each BW Consent to be processed despite our technical expertise and knowledge of what has gone before. This cannot be an effective use of time, resources or due process. At some point Scottish Government must realise the need for Professional based Self-Certification for the Domestic Building Standards. As Chartered Architects & Certified Passivhaus Designers we must be permitted to work effectively to support the the public sector in delivering more and better quality housing.

In my case, it was a waste of time, plus more money and frustration to go back and forth because one controller had agreed something with us which we did and the final visit we were surprised by a new person who had never been part of the project and asked us to change over 10 things which we had already communicated and approved etc..

- lack of knowledge by some of the controllers.. The second controller who came by had not much knowledge about technical aspects but insisted all changes be made based on his logic - even though he colleague plus the architect, and the engineer and technical experts told him otherwise (the change only happened because at the end his boss also told him otherwise).
- it would have been good to have a CERITIFCATE of completion. I didnt get any documents telling me or confirming that the work has been finalised - but i submitted the application for completion. It was only confirmed to me in an email when i asked about it (that no further documents will be sent and that all is good etc..) I would have liked to have an official document or digital confirmation so when i come to sell the property i have everything in order.

Warranty applications are made and numerous items returned even when there is significant information submitted by various professionals. It is then difficult to clear these objections as these are delivered in one line answers or could be explained using common sense approach. In addition, items are added to the list after the initial report which makes it impossible for professionals, clients and contractors to accurately price, programme and evaluate a project.
Of all the Local Authorities, West Lothian Council is particularly bad in making the warrant process a sensible and helpful journey. My understanding from developers is that the whole approach stifles investment and development within the area.
Also very unhelpful, West Lothian Council are the only Local Authority I know that will not make a completion inspection to a property if an Amendment to Warrant is pending. Even if the amendment has been requested by the council. The amendments inevitably take weeks/months to process and the building user is left frustrated. ",2,"Communication is reasonable. However, it seems mostly ticking a box. The Building Standards department is quick to respond to return drawings during warrant application but without working with professionals to help clear the items and often adding more items. Therefore, it is all good sending back to the agent quickly but overall communication and procedure very poor. Noted it is stated on your return letters ""For your information, during the financial year 2021/2022 we granted 99.91% of all applications within 10 days of receiving all the necessary information"".

Sara-Louise frustrated the process and made inappropriate comments over a phone call of the 6 March 2024 at 13:20 when I called her asking for assistance on one of the queries in her warrant report. The query in question was asking for a fire-test certificate from a cladding manufacturer for untreated wood. Having spoken to several cladding manufacturers and wood associations, they all stated it was a well-known industry fact that untreated wood achieves class D or E for spread of fire - indeed, TRADA state that timber can be used for fire-stopping cavities around windows. When I made this point to Sara-Louise she did not accept it. When I asked her what other agents had provided her in the past, she told me, 'They've given me what I asked for'. When I pushed this further, she asked me, 'why does the client want to use timber cladding - it won't look good'. I was stunned by this question and repeated it to her to clarify - hopefully you record all your calls and pull this one up. Not only would the warrant officer not provide assistance for the job she undertakes, i.e., assisting with the building regulations, but she then found it appropriate to comment on the design of the proposal. Her attitude and behaviour was completely unacceptable and have resulted in a delay of at least 6 weeks to my client, who meanwhile has not been able to move into her property until the warrant has been approved and works taken place. I cannot express enough how utterly dissatisfied and shocked I am at the service I've received from Midlothian Council - the worst experience of dealing with Councils in my 10 years of being a practicing Architect.
