I have never in over 20yrs experienced such wilful obstruction. ,4,4,3,The entire service was totally dysfunctional in this instance. The only reason I note the response time as poor and not very poor is because the officer returned warrant reports very quickly.

My experience was of a wilful and malicious abuse of authority.,4,"As noted in all answers above they service received was not only totally unacceptable I seemed to be subject to the will of a surveyor who had gone totally rouge. I did have commutations with his line manager and at one stage was told that there were know issues and its implied that there was nothing that could be done avoid the issues. This is totally unacceptable. I believe that the there were potentially health issues with the surveyor , but I think that it is a total management failure that they were left to operate unsupervised. This caused a great deal of stress for me personally and also the client, not to mention the consequential delay and expense.
