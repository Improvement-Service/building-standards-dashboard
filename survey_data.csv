This made the whole process very protracted. ,4,The warrant reports were terrible and not constructive. The warrant officer would not discuss the application so it was impossible to get any direction on requirements and despite numerous resubmissions most of the comments remained. I have never in over 20yrs experienced such wilful obstruction. ,4,4,3,The entire service was totally dysfunctional in this instance. The only reason I note the response time as poor and not very poor is because the officer returned warrant reports very quickly. The reports however took no cognisance of the revised submission and just repeated the same points. ,4,Fairness was even a consideration. My experience was of a wilful and malicious abuse of authority.,4,"As noted in all answers above they service received was not only totally unacceptable I seemed to be subject to the will of a surveyor who had gone totally rouge. I did have commutations with his line manager and at one stage was told that there were know issues and its implied that there was nothing that could be done avoid the issues. This is totally unacceptable. I believe that the there were potentially health issues with the surveyor , but I think that it is a total management failure that they were left to operate unsupervised. This caused a great deal of stress for me personally and also the client, not to mention the consequential delay and expense.

The lack of initiative and forethought shown by supposedly competent council officers is appalling. Petty excuses why a simple task or request can't be met/done seem all to ready to be used. I had to speak to a senior office (Head of Service), who was excellent, to get anything near the quality of service and advice I would expect of professionals and I work in the property sector.

Previous plans were not available due to a 'broken' piece of equipment. There was no flexibility in the system. Actually speaking to an officer was extremely difficult. Advice on the Council website regards this department was incorrect. Only when I pushed on a point did progress happen.  ,"My experience was one where the Council no longer exists to serve the people within the city, but to put up reasons why some simple task can't be done.
I call on council services very rarely. I have worked in local government for over a decade and to an extent understand the demands placed on it. I am a reasonable and educated individual but found the Glasgow City Council almost impenetrable. Front line staff appear to lack basic knowledge of the service they provide. Officers are only available at certain point of the day and days of the week. I had to badger and push to get a sensible conversation to explain my situation, ask questions as to what was required of me in order to expedite my reason for calling on the council service. The senior officer (Head of Service) was very helpful, but the level of information I was seeking should be provided by front line staff, not senior management!!!
Please can Glasgow City cease using their automated phone call routing and employ humans with an understanding of Council services and can direct calls to another human. The phone system is clearly designed to put people off making contact with the council or give up very quickly on their journey.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

I accept that this was brought in to prevent developers sitting on swathes of land and applications for years before progressing but in the case of domestic projects it can cause some issues.  I often have several projects on the go at one time and that includes both planning and warrant.  In that case it's really easy to loose track of timeframes for projects especially when dealing with a client who is either changing their mind or wants to approach a project at their pace on site.  Similarly obtaining tenders is now almost impossible in the old school 3 week timeframe and in some cases can be months.  I think both planning & building standards need to have clear contact instructions from an agent prior to issuing a deemed refusal.  This often doesn't happen and can lead to having to re-apply which really is a waste of time for both the agent and Building Standards.  Whikst I can see the need for the process I think there should be a better way of handling it.,1,1,1,-,1,-,1,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

As an Agent you can no longer rely on the information given to you by the approving officer. You have to warn clients that the Building Warrant Approval is meaningless and not worth the paper it is written on. To do your job professionally, you have to alert clients that they must set aside additional funds to remedy concerns at the end of project, not raised in the original approval.
